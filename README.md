# Goûtons Voir

Dear Oenophiles, 

Have you ever wondered what separates a good quality Wine from an average quality Wine? What goes in the Wine; giving it that tart, sweet and fruity taste? 
Introducing “Goûtons Voir” (an expression in French meaning: “Let’s Taste”), a virtual Wine expert that employs Machine Learning techniques to predict the quality of Wine. 

This virtual Wine expert mimics the expertise of an actual expert and can predict quality Red wine based on the quantity of each chemical that goes in - resulting in either a poor quality or a high quality wine. 

This endeavor not only helped me understand what goes into implementing an end-to-end ML project but also enlightened me about the chemical composition of Wines and that the alchemy of flavors plays a pivotal role in producing superlative Wines.

You too could play around with numbers and see for yourself, as to what makes a good Wine. 

Cheers!!! 🍷
